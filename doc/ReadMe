POINTERS to functions below, as requested in rubric


Rubric #4 = Welford's
	CrosswalkSIM/classes/stats/ print_final_statistics <AND> track_statistics
Rubric #5 = Expontential variate calculations
	CrosswalkSIM/classes/input/ getNextAutoInterarrival <AND> getNextPedInterarrival
Rubric #5 part 2 = proof that N arrivals are not generated all at once
	CrosswalkSIM/classes/input/ getNextAutoInterarrival >>calls>> readNextUniformInTrace() >>calls>> readFile() >> line 112: filename.readLine()
	Note: All files are opened once in SIM line 311, read line by line to get each arrival time one at a time, and then closed in classes/input/ closeFiles()
Rubric #6 = Not using a simple list for event list, instead using a queue
	CrosswalkSIM/classes/event/ line 10: event_list = Q.PriorityQueue()
	Note: Main loop in SIM, which starts at line 112, shows things being removed from the top of the queue with get()  (at line 115)
	In the same file, spawnAuto() and spawnPed() add to the queue. These are just a few examples of where the queue is used.
